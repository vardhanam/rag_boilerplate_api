Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) : Nice phone: Good Google Pixel 3 Verizon 64GB Black : Poor imitation of iPhone. Impossible to hold.: Software is good, but the phone design is a horrible imitation of the latest iPhone with rounded edges, which makes the device not only ugly, but impossible to hold. No grip and slippery. I should have kept my Pixel 2. IPhone is a dying breed, it is a shame that Google is trying to cooy it. I used to like Android because it was not Apple. Now, I will have to wait for something else. Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black) : Brand New: The package arrived on time and it was brand new out of the box. For real, it was like I bought it brand new out the store. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935FD 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE : Exceptional quality and all around beautiful, however- the way it's configured: Exceptional quality and all around beautiful, however- the way it's configured, system wise. It becomes difficult to figure out how to navigate and find the way to correctly install some apps without an actual 'owners book/manual (not included.oh, it's on the phone itself ) had to go to 'you tube' to watch a video's in order to understand on how to do so. PAIN IN THE ASS, I must say. Also very difficult to get/find an exceptable screen cover/shield that fits correctly, so far the one's i've tride won't adhere to the surface, the way the phone edge curves. Anyways....... Samsung Convoy 4 B690 Rugged Water-Resistant Verizon Flip Phone w/ 5MP Camera - Blue (Renewed) : Bad out of box: Did not work after charging the entire night, was returned, refund issued.\",\n",
       "  'Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited : Five Stars: great Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only) : Great as miniature WiFi \"tablet\": Watch the price, as these are great as a cheap, nearly disposable WiFi-only device. At recent prices, a new one is probably not worth it but the used market thrives. Note that the battery is permanently attached so refreshing an abused phone isn\\'t an option, either. Stick with Fulfilled by Amazon, very good condition, and return one that\\'s not as advertised. Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - Black : Very dissatisfied: I can\\'t receive pictures or get on the internet. This phone doesn\\'t have a flash so all pictures are dark Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus (S8+) (SM-G955FD) 4GB RAM / 64GB ROM 6.2-Inch 12MP 4G LTE Dual SIM FACTORY UNLOCKED - International Stock No Warranty (MIDNIGHT BLACK) : It was not working: None working phone for sell Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935FD 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE : Three Stars: This product was purchased for another person. Samsung Galaxy S4, White Frost 16GB (Sprint) : Love it: I love it Xiaomi MI Mix 3 (128GB, 6GB) 6.39\" Display, Dual SIM 4G LTE GSM Unlocked Multi-Functional Magnetic Slider Smartphone w/Wireless Charging Pad (Black) : Awesome device: Really liking this device, very fast and responsive I\\'m upgrading from a Mi 8 and I can tell the difference between the 2 devices. Even though it has a SD 845, last year chipset, it\\'s still really good in 2019. Having 6GB RAM makes every app runs very smooth. Didn\\'t have any issues with connective using US carrier (T-MOBILE) whether receiving calls/texts/notifications, I like that it has NFC specially for using multiple headphones/ear buds it made it easy to pair. No issues on running any apps runs smooth. Yeah it has a ceramic back, which attracts fingerprints but that\\'s normal with the new cell phones now a days, whether it\\'s ceramic, glass or even high gloss plastic back. It will leave fingerprints. I know that most of Xiaomi phones doesn\\'t have a app drawer but that\\'s an easy fix. Download a free app launcher from Google Play store. The MIUI OS is easy to get used too. The gesture navigation is amazing. The slider is built solid, no issues on using it whether taking selfies or just sliding it up & down. Probably want to get a case for the phone, it a slippery phone. I don\\'t have a case because I\\'m using a pop socket. Definitely worth it. Loving the bezel less display, colors are nice and vibrant. Microsoft Lumia 950 32GB Dual Sim NAM RM-1118 GSM Factory Unlocked - US Warranty (Black) : Best Phone Ever: The only thing Android phones have over this one are the number of apps that are available. Other than that, this phone is better feature by feature than any Android or Apple phone on the market. The ease of use, camera, apps and privacy are all far superior. Too bad Microsoft no longer supports the platform. Shame on them, but not surprising. Typical of Microsoft to give up too soon. Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless) : One Star: Verizon was not able to activate phone. Nokia 7.1 - Android 9.0 Pie - 64 GB - Dual Camera - Dual SIM Unlocked Smartphone (Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile/MetroPCS/Cricket/H2O) - 5.84\" FHD+ HDR Screen - Steel - U.S. Warranty : Solid phone for under 400 bucks: Great phone, unfortunately my wife dropped it without a case so it shattered. Bloatfree android is a great experience and the phone is a nice size. Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) : Apple iPhone SX Max 64GB: I know it would have been great, but I ordered it by mistake. Had to send it back. Motorola DROID Turbo XT1254, Black Ballistic Nylon 32GB (Verizon Wireless) : Three Stars: new Google Pixel 2 XL 128 GB, Black (Renewed) : Awesome phone: I absolutely love the Google Pixel 2XL so far.. I joined Google Fi and transferred my number and it was really simple. The phone is in great condition. Will update later on..',\n",

Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black) : So Happy With My Purchase: I purchased this phone for my little girl for Christmas and was so excited that she opened it early.

I will be ordering myself one after Christmas Samsung Galaxy Note8 N950U 64GB Unlocked GSM LTE Android Phone w/ Dual 12 Megapixel Camera - Midnight Black : Four Stars: The unlocked version doesn\\'t have visual voicemail. Huawei Mate 10 Pro Unlocked Phone, 6\" 6GB/128GB, AI Processor, Dual Leica Camera, Water Resistant IP67, GSM Only - Mocha Brown (US Warranty) : AWESOME PHONE!: Bought this phone for my wife. No problems, fast phone, great Network coverage, fast WiFi speeds, awesome video quality... overall best affordable phone.. and we have Tmobile Samsung Galaxy A30 Dual SIM 32GB (SM-A305G/DS) Unlocked Phone GSM International Version - Blue : Isaiah: Love it!!!!! Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed) : Blown speaker with 72 hours: The phone\\'s speaker began to produce \"cracked\" sounds within 3 days of receiving the device. Was listening to music when I noticed the speaker sounded like it was already blown. Restarting the phone would initially fix the problem, but the issue would continually return minutes/hours after the restart. Phone now only produces \"cracked\" and distorted sounds. CR Land was the vendor to provide this unit. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+, Black 64GB (Sprint) : Pros ane cons for samsung galaxy s6 edge +: I have had this phone a few months now and would like to leave a review. Phone works great, great features, the edge screen is cool and has its own features. Very easy to use phone for any age. Con is it over heats on somephones. This is my second phone the first one over heated and I lost control of half my screen. Don\\'t let it sit on charger too long expecially fast charger. Would give five stars if it didn\\'t over heat as much. Still a good phone. Would recommend. Nokia Lumia 920, Black 32GB (AT&T) : Great phone, new features are really great.: I am a happy Nokia Lumia 900 phone user and I am so happy to finally get the Nokia Lumia 920 (Yellow) WP8 device. Happy to see the tiles are now customizable. Fell in-love with Lumia 900\\'s camera specially when taking videos and photos and guess what? Lumia 920 never fails me at all. We now have an option to shoot videos at 1080p (default is 720p) it will auto detect and turns the light on in low-light yes, during video recording. Aside from the tap and share photos we can now use the Nokia maps to share locations (for HTC WP8 users bing maps has this feature too). I also like the new Family Room feature where you can invite facebook friends/relatives or other person you want to add from your contact list so you can track events and recent activities of the people you know and care :) If you have kids definitely turn on the Kid\\'s corner so you can let your kids play your phone and not mess with it. I have posted some videos on my you tube channel (teknowsit) if you want to check Nokia Lumia\\'s 900 video on Richard Marx\\'s recent Seattle concert. I will soon upload my videos from my Lumia 920\\'s for future reference. Wish list: Hopefully in the future WP will be able to play the videos purchased from my xbox live account so I can have a complete user experience from xbox-surface-pc-phone devices.',\n",

The LCD screen is super-bright. Photos are good enough for me, not as good as my wife\\'s phone that\\'s worth 6x this but I expected that. Stock Android is really nice too. Very happy with this. Needs a case as the all-glass front and back makes it slide off every surface. Moto G - Verizon Prepaid Phone (Verizon Prepaid Only) : Five Stars: PERFECT!

It is possible it works in some places where T-Mobile still has 3G service on the listed bands, but that\\'s not the case in Seattle or San Francisco. ASUS ZenFone Max Plus ZB570TL-MT67-3G32G-BL - 5.7” 1920x1080-3GB RAM - 32GB storage - LTE Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone - US Warranty - Silver : bellísimos y excelente calidad: bellísimos y excelente calidad Samsung Galaxy S7 32GB G930V Unlocked - Black : Works, but screen was damaged: Works fine, but the screen was burned when it arrived. The previous owner clearly did a lot of driving, because their navigation app is permanently imprinted on it. It\\'s not unusable, but replacing the screen would cost more than I payed for the device Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, 5.5\" 32GB (Verizon Wireless) - Blue : THIS IS A HONEST TAKE ON A BEAUTIFUL PHONE: MUST COVER UP ALLTHE BEAUTY OF THIS PHONE.

Motorola Moto G7 Power 32GB+4GB RAM XT1955-2 LTE Factory Unlocked GSM 5000mAh Battery Smartphone (International Version) (Marine Blue) : First phone that I actually love.: For me the performance is impeccable. Apps open and work super fast, the wifi connects so quickly whenever I change locations that I don\\'t even notice a lag. The battery life is unbeatable, I use my phone about 45 minutes per day so I only have to charge once a week, and even when I decide to recharge I still have about 45% of charge left as a reserve!

       "  'Sony Xperia X F5121 32GB GSM 23MP Camera Phone - Graphite Black : vivid screen and stylish features makes the transition from iPhone to Android easy: For an iPhone user, adapting to the Android operating system takes patience, time and a certain reinvention of your normal Mac inclinations. Sony’s Xperia X Command cell phone (unlocked) is a superb device to acquaint the new user and transit from an iPhone 6 to Android OS. Xperia’s shiny screen, the same width as the iPhone, is 1/4” inch longer, noticeably brighter (radiant may be the right word), the colors richer and with more depth and click or swipe response time between apps markedly faster. Sony’s design is sleek and modern, corners are round, not sharp, the back is a hard tactile plastic but with an inexpensive slip case (from Amazon) secure and comfortable to one’s grip (the device’s length measures 5 ½” w/o slip case, 5 5/8 with case). Its battery charges up quickly; surely faster than the iPhone and can last for two (2) days according to the manufacturer. There is a modest amount of “bloatware” when one swipes left (games, etc.) but this is minor annoyance. The rear-mounted camera produces vivid photos with notable clarity and detail. It shoots videos or stills. For extra storage, a SD card tray is part of your carrier’s SIM tray on the side which makes the device ideal for watching sports or movies. The range of the Android OS impresses and this fine cell phone makes the transition a welcome treat. Samsung Galaxy J5 SM-J500H/DS GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone, International Version (Gold) : I love the camera features especially sine the forward camera has ...: No complaints. I just inserted my two sim cards and my memory card any the phone picked up both networks. I logged into my google accounts and al my apps were there and synced.

SOME... i had a 2690 until the battery life became <1hr, which was after 6 years ( still have it with my contacts) replaced it with a 220 or something (rubbish). had to get this blu thing which my then gf got for me. .. lasted about 15 months. questions i had: 1) it calls itself a nokia... but then so did the lumia thing 2) can it work in my area? ch 3 - Answers i am proud to declare myself as the first person in Trinidad and Tobago to own a new nokia. what really sold me was in the questions, the seller SPECIFICALLY says \"caribbean\" (july 14 2017)... a seller that cares about me.. all the way out here in the caribbean... nice marketing ploy. it works (on Bmobile) - but note a nanosim will be needed, so be prepared to get that stuff sorted out at TSTT. so question 2- answered .. why do i review it now?? because i was waiting for the right moment, which was earlier this week.. when it slipped out my pocket.. and fell tumbling down about 13 HARD terrazo steps (a height of approx 3-4 metres), it didn\\'t just land, i\\'m telling you.. it flipped, it pitched, it tumbled, it hit the step again and spiralled all the way down , eventually landing on its face in the corner of the staircase.. outside.. i was about to freak out but .. finally! a fall... if a nokia can\\'t take a fall.. it doesn\\'t deserve to even be in the same sentence with the word nokia... ... this phone survived... what\\'s more... i picked it up... and continued to play my game on it (which is what i was reaching it to do) so.... i love it... from an old school nokia whore.. it performs as i would expect... and this was enough for me. it loses 0.5 star.. because i will never give something a full 5... not unless it is really really REALLY REALLY splendid... ch 4 - other nitty gritty for people actually caring for a \"review\" 1) its operation is... i guess par. that aforementioned blu was my first smartphone, i deliberately go against the grain, which \"smartphone\" is a part of- my experience on smartphones and their capabilities is limited so i don\\'t know what the other products out there offer. 2) this does play pokemon go however, i couldn\\'t with the blu (? due to lousy specs) .. i\\'m a year late but .. yay for me.. screw the haters. (i guess this reveals as well that the bar might be a bit low) 3) the camera is awesome tho... quite sublime quality imho 4) i bought with the phone the screen protector- which has cracked, but still works. i want to mention that the other day i lifted it out , and the actual screen of the phone is flawless still, i\\'ve never had a phone... this long... with a scratchless screen. basically, when i change the protector... this phone will look like new. 5) the weight is light (compared to my friend\\'s phones at least.. in my opinion 6) battery life is good, takes about 4 hrs to charge , which can last a little over a day i estimate (if i don\\'t play pokemon) ch 5 - reservations only a few. a) i personally would have found this phone easier to operate, had it had the traditional nokia menus... you know... where settings had date/time settings, call settings, phone settings etc ... that menu that all nokia whores would know.. its a little tricky finding what i need to, but i understand that they have to be a',\n",
       "  'HUAWEI P20 Lite (32GB + 4GB RAM) 5.84\" FHD+ Display, 4G LTE Dual SIM GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone ANE-LX3 - International Model - No Warranty (Sakura Pink) : Over all I seem to like it after aout 5 months.: So far voice recognition is a pain. Most of the time I will speak my message, nothing comes up for say around 4 seconds, then pops in place and have to restart the voice process (just takes a finger touch) again. Second most dislike. Definitely finds sounds everywhere, so make sure for eg. the TV sound is off. I may not know a better place, but to start the voice message you have a itty bitty place to start it, which is on the key pad that comes up. And if you do not hit it long enough or exactly on the spot all you get is a bunch of ....... This feature I really dislike the most. Takes, what appears, very good pictures. Crisp voice on incoming calls, and others say to me can hear me clearly. On my phone anyway, there are three boxes with numerous apps on them, and one must hit this box, then hit app. One is google, one is tools, and one is top apps. Play store and settings is on the top apps. Mild pain to remember what each one has in them. Have not figured out yet how to give phone more time before it shuts itself off automatically. Sometimes 5-6 seconds is not long enough. Seems loud enough. Battery life, in my opinion, is excellent. There are couple other mild things I wish was better such as on the bottom you have for eg. the back arrow, Nice and crisp when turn it on, but when you get a site you want on the phone the back arrow all but disappears and you kind of have to guess where it is at. There are many likes (can go to foreign country and not have to take out my provider sim lte, because have two areas that can use. Is unlocked which I really like. Screen is very nice size. Of course my likes are only opinions, so study what others have to say. I would buy again. Seems like a good value for the buck. Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (SM-N960F/DS) 6GB / 128GB (Ocean Blue) 6.4-inches LTE Dual SIM (GSM ONLY, NO CDMA) Factory Unlocked - International Stock No Warranty : Not working at all how i return this phon please: It is not working properly Iam regret to buy this phon sorry Samsung Galaxy S6 G920T 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Android Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - Black : My mom loves it!: Mom needed a new phone so got her this and she loves it Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - Black : Four Stars: Great phone!!! Sony Xperia XA1 G3123 32GB Unlocked GSM LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 23MP Camera - White : Good phone: I\\'ve had ASUS phones for several years now, and I still love ASUS phones. The SONY XPERIA XA1 is a good little phone. It\\'s not a power house and it doesn\\'t have above average picture quality, but overall the phone does what I need it to. I wanted a smaller, lighter weight phone, and compared to my ASUS phones, this is much smaller and lighter. Don\\'t expect to do a lot of high demand gaming and son\\'t expect to see extreme clarity in the photography, but if you\\'re looking for a quality phone with good features and good battery life that is light weight and stylish then this is the phone for you. This phone also has a very good cellular antenna that picks up strong GSM signal and LTE in places that my other phones get little or no signal in. Overall a good phone that does exactly what I need it to. Samsung Galaxy S7 - Black - 32GB - Verizon (Renewed) : Worth it: I loved that I was able to find the same phone for fairly cheap after cracking the screen on my other one. Came very quickly, and with a charger, which I wasn\\'t expecting. I was disappointed that the main button was already chipped/worn when I got it. But on my old phone (same galaxy s7) that was the first thing to happen, and it didn\\'t affect the functionality. So I guess you get what you pay for. Not a perfect phone, but worth it as a cheaper substitution than buying a brand new phone.',\n",
       "  'Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 32 GB - No Warranty - Black : Three Stars: Okay phone. Received with a few scratches Samsung Galaxy S4, White Frost 16GB (AT&T) : Great phone, BAD Lollipop!: I felt compelled to write a review on the 32Gb Samsung Galaxy S4 after having just received a big disappointment in ordering a used \"Like New\" example of this now obsolete AT&T model you can\\'t otherwise buy anymore. I\\'ve owned this model for two and a half years; several of them; including S3 and Note 3s. I know this phone very well, and I have suffered through all the renditions of Google\\'s different Android firmware upgrades, beginning with 2.*. You might see I have given this phone FIVE STARS. But I had to return the phone, because unlike what it was advertised to have as 4.2 Jelly Bean software, it came to me with 5.0.1 Lollipop. I CAN\\'T STAND LOLLIPOP. I cannot use the words I would like to properly describe how much I HATE LOLLIPOP. It was not what was advertised, so back it goes. LOLLIPOP, as with all the Android Firmware variants since inception, are a 3-way partnership between: GOOGLE, the Phone Manufacturer, and the Service Provider. In my case, these latter two are Samsung (obviously), and AT&T. The User Interface (UI) on Lollipop is as if you are dealing with an entirely new company on the other side of the planet. There is very little familiarity between Kit Kat (the predecessor) and Lollipop. I have always TURNED OFF a lot of the canned software in all my versions of Android, up through 4.4.4. They became trickier as the newer versions came out. Now, with Lollipop, you can\\'t turn off any of the ones that are important to turn off, if you want to extend your battery life, and especially if you want some measure of SECURITY and PRIVACY. Both AT&T and Samsung, have loaded their two-cents worth of bloat-ware (unnecessary, self serving branded software); but Google has made it mandatory for you to have \"Google Play Services\" turned on, IF you want access to your contacts! Google has made a big mistake with Lollipop, and believe it or not, it is already being replaced by \"6.0\" and a new name (that I forget). The User Interface is everything, and by changing it as drastically as they did, they have alienated many professional people who depend on the familiarity of their calendar settings, contact lists and editing them, and many other things that have now been changed. It is an UGLY, UGLY, monochrome style UI. It is WHITE background with Black (and pale blue accents) text. Photos are little circles now. But worse of all, is all the crap software they\\'ve added you don\\'t need, and can\\'t turn off. It is all designed to keep track of YOU, or get you to BUY something, or GIVE something to them -- like more and more of your personal information in order to fully use features of the phone that was once free without taxing you for your personal history and profiles. How you use your phone, who you call, what you surf on the Internet and all your contact information is being absorbed by these corporate monsters for the sole purpose of CONTROLING YOU, today and in the future. Lollipop makes it easier for them to do this. You can ROOT your phone, and become an IT engineer if you want; but as rich as all these companies have become from consumer patronage, we shouldn\\'t have to give up more and more time, learning new User Interfaces, and surrendering our privacy and habits because they shove software and phones down our throats that we can\\'t control, can\\'t turn off, can\\'t customize for our preferred use. We used to have these perks. But now they are very expensive, or non-existent.

We wanted something reasonably priced, as we are beginners with these types of phones. It has a good mp3 music player, great volume. The camera is good, but is only on one side, so, sorry no selfies for him. It does not have a flash. The user downloads a ton of apps, and all have worked great.

This X4 did not disappoint! It is fast, clear, easy to use..and I will never buy a full price phone again. Unlocked and at a fraction of the price of the other phones out there, this phone is a bargain. I am not a techno freak so minor things do not bother me. I use the phone as a phone, for email and texting. Picture taking is not that important to me but this camera looks great so far. I love the no touch hand hover to see the screen for the time and notifications. The battery lasts me two days normally. Charges very quick. I have only had this phone for a few weeks, so I may update this review if anything good or bad comes along. Just a warning on the price. Seems like it goes up and down like a yo yo. It is now double the price I paid a just a few weeks ago. My price was under 150 for the blue 32mb model with no Amazon ads...so look for that price point. You may be able to get the Amazon prime phone with ads in black cheaper yet. My wifes phone has the ads, I have yet to hear her complain about them. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone.

Granted that upgrading to any phone from the Rhyme is a big plus, but I digress. Anyway, I really love this phone because for one the OS is really simple and easy to understand and customize. The call quality have been very clear and easy to understand, and the camera is out of this world. I go to a lot of shows and can record a band so well that it looks professional. Bottom line, this is an amazing phone and the apps are really coming around. Thumbs up!

I wanted something that wasn\\'t historic like a flip phone, cost effective and still maintained some of the more expensive smart phone features. I found that in this phone. The phone was reasonably priced. I can vouch that it is a Tmobile phone that came in T-Mobile packaging that I was able to activate with no problems. I\\'m adjusting to the Windows phone format having been using a Galaxy for many years, but it\\'s not bad at all. I still can message, check email, download apps (have to have my Kindle) and access Internet. The camera is only-rear-facing making those selfies harder to capture (lol), but it\\'s not that big of a deal! I\\'m actually enjoying this phone, and considering the price compared to paying $200-$500 for a more expensive smartphone (and that\\'s older versions, or refurbished) you really can\\'t beat that. If you are just venturing into smartphone land and want an easy transition, this is a great user-friendly phone.

Sony Xperia XZ F8332 64GB Forest Blue, 5.2\", Dual Sim, GSM Unlocked International Model, No Warranty : My experience.: Love the product, no complaints! I had no problems with the phone itself, but I received a charger I was unable to use. I read the reviews and Q&A\\'s and thought it came with an American charger. This is not a complaint on the seller, just to inform others, that even though you read through the reviews and Q&A\\'s, it is better to contact seller directly about any questions you may have.
